Welcome to My Dice-Based Turn Decider!

This is a simple terminal program which, when provided with a player count, will roll die proportional to that count,
accumulate the rolls, and compare sums to create an ordered output of who should go first!

  - The individual rolls are colored from low to high with red, yellow, and green respectively.
  - The final sums are also colored similarly but the divisions will be based on the number of players
